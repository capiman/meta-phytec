meta-phytec
===========

This is the official hardware support layer for PHYTEC Boards.
Meta-phytec is a BSP layer, it is distribution independent and delivers
bootloader and kernel to our customers.
If you are interested in a fully tested and configured Linux
distribution, consider working with

  <https://git.phytec.de/meta-ampliphy>

which is PHYTEC's distribution based on Poky.

Releases are functional tested, supported and maintained. They can be
accessed by our repo manifest.

  <https://git.phytec.de/phy2octo>

We have a small wrapper to guide you through the release setup.

```
wget https://download.phytec.de/Software/Linux/Yocto/Tools/phyLinux
chmod +x ./phyLinux
./phyLinux init
```

Further information about the hardware can be found on our webpage:

  <https://www.phytec.de>

If you experience any problem with this software, please contact our
<support@phytec.de> or the maintainer directly.
Please try to do the following first:

* look in the
  [Yocto Project Bugzilla](http://bugzilla.yoctoproject.org/)
  to see if a problem has already been reported
* look through recent entries of the
  [Yocto mailing list archives](https://lists.yoctoproject.org/pipermail/yocto/)
  to see if other people have run into similar
  problems or had similar questions answered.

kas
===

The kas subfolder contains build configurations for the kas setup tool. Those
build configurations run in our CI or cover certain use cases and cannot be
seen as releases. Releases are provided through our repo manifest repository.
Information about the tool can be found here:

 <https://kas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>

Some use cases are covered:

1. build a poky image for phytec hardware

 $ kas build meta-phytec/kas/poky-phytec.yml

2. work on a poky upstream feature:

 $ kas checkout meta-phytec/kas/poky-phytec.yml
 # work on the layers
 $ kas build meta-phytec/kas/poky-phytec-local.yml
